abstract={IoT big data real-time analytics systems need to effectively process and manage massive amounts of data from streams produced by distributed data sources. There are many challenges in deploying and managing processing logic at execution time in those systems, especially when 24x7 availability is required. Aiming to address those challenges, we have developed and tested a middleware for Distributed CEP, with a data-centric and dynamic design, based on the Data Distribution Service for RealTime Systems (OMG-DDS) specification and its extension for dynamic topics/types (DDS-XTypes). Its main advantages include the use of OMG-DDS; witch is suitable for IoT applications with QoS requirements, its dynamic capabilities, and the scalable and parallel execution of the CEP rules on a dynamic set of processing nodes.},

ABSTRACT = {Today, big data are generated from many sources, and there is a huge demand for storing, managing, processing, and querying on big data. The MapReduce model and its counterpart open source implementation Hadoop, has proven itself as the de facto solution to big data processing, and is inherently designed for batch and high throughput processing jobs. Although Hadoop is very suitable for batch jobs, there is an increasing demand for non-batch requirements like: interactive jobs, real-time queries, and big data streams. Since Hadoop is not suitable for these non-batch workloads, new solutions are proposed to these new challenges. In this article, we discussed two categories of these solutions: real-time processing, and stream processing of big data. For each category, we discussed paradigms, strengths and differences to Hadoop. We also introduced some practical systems and frameworks for each category. Finally, some simple experiments were performed to approve effectiveness of new solutions compared to available  Hadoop-based solutions.},

abstract="`Smart cities' is a term that has gained traction in academia, business and government to describe cities that, on the one hand, are increasingly composed of and monitored by pervasive and ubiquitous computing and, on the other, whose economy and governance is being driven by innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, enacted by smart people. This paper focuses on the former and, drawing on a number of examples, details how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce `big data'. Such data, smart city advocates argue enables real-time analysis of city life, new modes of urban governance, and provides the raw material for envisioning and enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities. The final section of the paper provides a critical reflection on the implications of big data and smart urbanism, examining five emerging concerns: the politics of big urban data, technocratic governance and city development, corporatisation of city governance and technological lock-ins, buggy, brittle and hackable cities, and the panoptic city.",

abstract = {As more applications are being moved to the Cloud thanks to serverless computing, it is increasingly necessary to support native life cycle execution of those applications in the data center.But existing systems either focus on short-running workflows (like IBM Composer or Amazon Express Workflows) or impose considerable overheads for synchronizing massively parallel jobs (Azure Durable Functions, Amazon Step Functions, Google Cloud Composer). None of them are open systems enabling extensible interception and optimization of custom workflows.We present Triggerflow: an extensible Trigger-based Orchestration architecture for serverless workflows built on top of Knative Eventing and Kubernetes technologies. We demonstrate that Triggerflow is a novel serverless building block capable of constructing different reactive schedulers (State Machines, Directed Acyclic Graphs, Workflow as code). We also validate that it can support high-volume event processing workloads, auto-scale on demand and transparently optimize scientific workflows.},

abstract = {The introduction of a Software-defined infrastructures brings additional challenges to the management of cloud infrastructure. With the impending convergence of telecommunications and cloud infrastructures, datacenters become an essential part of an overall integrated environment. The potential scale of such environments has significant implications as traditional orchestration approaches cannot scale appropriately. However, the combination of infrastructure topology, fine-grained operational data and advanced analytics, has the potential to deliver a scalable approach to facilitate orchestration and resource management. In this paper we introduce Apex Lake, a framework designed to address the question of "how to efficiently define and maintain a physical and logical resource and service landscape enriched by operational data, to support orchestration for optimized service delivery?" We also demonstrate with a use-case illustrating how functionalities provided by Apex Lake can be used dealing with performance anomalies.},

abstract="A large number of cloud providers offer diverse types of cloud services for constructing complex ''cloud-native'' software. However, there is a lack of supporting tools and mechanisms for accelerating the development of cloud-native software-defined elastic systems (SESs) based on elasticity capabilities of cloud services. In this paper we introduce QUELLE -- a framework for evaluating and recommending SES deployment configurations. QUELLE presents models for describing the elasticity capabilities of cloud services and capturing elasticity requirements of SESs. Based on that QUELLE introduces novel functions and algorithms for quantifying the elasticity capabilities of cloud services. QUELLE's algorithms can recommend SES deployment configurations from cloud services that both provide the required elasticity, and fulfill cost, quality, and resource requirements, and thus can be incorporated into different phases of the development of SESs. We present several experiments based on real-world cloud services for the development of an elastic machine-to-machine data-as-a-service system.",
